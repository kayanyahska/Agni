## E-VOTING SYSTEM USING MICROSOFT AZURE BLOCKCHAIN
## Abstract
We are implementing voting system using Azure Blockchain. We aim to achieve a secure and robust system that ensures anonymity of the voter, transparency in the process and provable correctness. Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results.
